# Python Mathematics Game

## Overview

This is a simple command-line mathematics game where the player is asked basic addition and subtraction questions. The player has a limited amount of time to answer each question, and the time limit decreases as more questions are answered correctly.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to learn Python as a new programming language while improving skills in AI prompting. Generative AI is used to guide the learning process, problem-solving, and implementation of the game.

## Usage

When the game starts, the player is asked whether they want to play. If the player agrees, the game begins by presenting simple addition or subtraction questions. The player must answer each question within the given time limit. The game ends when the player enters an incorrect answer or runs out of time, and the final score is displayed.
